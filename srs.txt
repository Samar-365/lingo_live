## **Lingo-Live: Real-Time Screen Translation System**

---

## **1. Introduction**

### **1.1 Purpose**

The purpose of this document is to describe the software requirements for **Lingo-Live**, a desktop-based real-time screen translation system. The system uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text from screen content and translates it using a language translation API. This document serves as a reference for developers, instructors, and evaluators.

---

### **1.2 Scope**

Lingo-Live enables users to translate text displayed on their screens that cannot be copied directly, such as text in images, videos, PDFs, or legacy applications. The system captures a selected screen region, performs OCR, translates the extracted text, and displays the result as a floating overlay using a modern graphical interface built with **CustomTkinter**.

## **2. Overall Description**

### **2.1 Product Perspective**

Lingo-Live is a standalone desktop application developed in Python. It operates as a background utility that interacts with the operating system to capture screen regions and track mouse position. The system integrates OCR and a translation API, while the user interface is implemented using **CustomTkinter**, an enhanced version of Tkinter that provides a modern appearance.

---

### **2.2 Product Functions**

* Capture a region of the screen near the mouse cursor
* Extract text from captured images using OCR
* Translate extracted text into a user-selected language (Primary: Lingo.dev API, Fallback: Google Translate)
* Display translated text in a floating overlay window
* Summarize translated text using Google Gemini API (`gemini-2.5-flash`)
* Read aloud the translated text using high-quality Text-to-Speech (TTS)
* Provide user control via keyboard shortcuts and UI options

---

### **2.3 User Classes and Characteristics**

* **General Users**: Users requiring instant translation of on-screen text
* **Students**: Users accessing foreign-language learning resources
* **Professionals**: Users working with multilingual software

No prior technical knowledge is required to use the system.

---

### **2.4 Operating Environment**

* Operating System: Windows / macOS / Linux
* Programming Language: Python
* OCR Engine: Tesseract OCR
* UI Framework: **CustomTkinter**
* Screen Capture: MSS
* Internet Connection: Required for translation API

---

### **2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints**

* OCR accuracy depends on text clarity and image resolution
* Internet access is required for real-time translation
* Screen capture size is limited to ensure performance
* System permissions are required for screen access

---

## **3. System Requirements**

### **3.1 Functional Requirements**

**FR1:** The system shall allow users to initiate translation using a global keyboard shortcut.

**FR2:** The system shall capture a predefined screen region around the mouse pointer.

**FR3:** The system shall extract text from the captured image using an OCR engine.

**FR4:** The system shall translate the extracted text using a translation API.

**FR5:** The system shall display the translated text in a floating overlay window built using CustomTkinter.

**FR6:** The system shall allow users to select the target language through the UI.

**FR7:** The system shall automatically hide the translation overlay after a fixed duration.

**FR8:** The system shall provide a "Read Aloud" feature to speak the translated text using Microsoft Edge TTS.

**FR9:** The system shall allow users to summarize the translated text via a button ("✨"), using the Google Gemini API.

**FR10:** The system shall display the summary in the target language (same as translation).

**FR11:** The system shall clearly display both original and translated text in separate sections, even if identical.

**FR12:** The system shall persist user preferences (hotkeys, opacity, language) across sessions.

---

### **3.2 Non-Functional Requirements**

**NFR1 (Performance):**
The system shall display translated text within 2 seconds of activation.

**NFR2 (Usability):**
The system shall provide a clean, modern, and intuitive interface using CustomTkinter.

**NFR3 (Reliability):**
The system shall handle OCR or network failures gracefully.

**NFR4 (Portability):**
The system shall be portable across major desktop operating systems.

**NFR5 (Security):**
The system shall not permanently store captured screen data.

## **4. External Interface Requirements**

### **4.1 User Interface**

* Floating borderless overlay window (CustomTkinter)
* Language selection dropdown
* Minimal settings panel
* Keyboard shortcut support

---

### **4.2 Hardware Interfaces**

* Mouse and keyboard
* Display monitor

---

### **4.3 Software Interfaces**

* Tesseract OCR engine
* Translation API: Lingo.dev API (Primary), Google Translate (Fallback)
* Summarization API: Google Gemini API (Model: `gemini-2.5-flash`)
* Text-to-Speech: Microsoft Edge TTS (via edge-tts library)
* Operating system screen capture service

---

## **5. System Architecture Overview**

The system is divided into the following modules:

1. Mouse Tracking Module
2. Screen Capture Module
3. OCR Processing Module
4. Translation Module
5. CustomTkinter-based Overlay UI Module
6. Settings & Configuration Module

---

## **6. Assumptions and Dependencies**

* Users have a stable internet connection
* OCR engine is properly installed and configured
* Captured screen content is legible

---

## **7. Future Enhancements**

* Automatic language detection
* Hover-based translation without shortcuts
* Translation history and bookmarks
* Offline translation support
* Improved OCR preprocessing

---

## **8. Conclusion**

Lingo-Live provides an efficient solution for translating inaccessible on-screen text in real time. By combining OCR, translation APIs, and a modern CustomTkinter interface, the system delivers a fast, user-friendly desktop translation experience.
